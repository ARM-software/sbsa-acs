Please Note: The code in the "pal_baremetal" directory is only a reference code for implementation of PAL API's and it has not been verified on any model or SoC's.
The directory pal_baremetal consists of the reference code of the PAL API's specific to a platform.
Description of each directory are as follows:

1. src: The implementation common to all the baremetal platforms (like FVP and juno) for all modules are in the source directory.
2. include:
  -  pcie_enum.h: Implementation needed for enumeration.
  -  pal_common_support.h: Implementation that is common to both platforms (FVP and juno).
3. FVP: Contains Platform specific code. The details in this folder need to be modified w.r.t the platform.
4. Juno: Contains Platform specific code.

## Build Steps

Reference Makefile is present at [Makefile](../../Makefile). To compile SBSA, perform following steps.
1. cd sbsa-acs
2. export SBSA_PATH=pointing to SBSA directory
3. export GCC49_AARCH64_PREFIX=GCC toolchain path pointing to /bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-
4. make

The output library files will be generated at <sbsa_path>/build/lib/

Note: Any platform specific changes can be done by using TARGET_EMULATION macro defintion

For more details on how to port the reference code to a specific platform and for further customisation please refer to the [User Guide](docs/Arm_SBSA_ACS_Bare-metal_User_Guide.pdf)
