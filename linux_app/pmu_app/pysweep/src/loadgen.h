/*
Synthetic workload generator / executor.

This module constructs and executes synthetic workloads based on a set of
generic input parameters (characteristics) describing aspects such as

   - code working set
   - data working set
   - branch predictability
   - use of various instruction groups

The resulting workload, when run, should consume CPU and system resources
corresponding to its characteristics.
