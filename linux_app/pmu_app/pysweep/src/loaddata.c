 * WorkingSet object.
 *

 * Can be fed a trace and will update the working set properties.
 *
 * Currently this is very simplistic.
 *
 * We don't attempt to characterize how this working set would
 * interact with various cache geometries. For example,
 * a working set which consisted of accesses at n, n+4K, n+8K
 * etc. might have a lot of conflicts due to aliasing.
 *
 * Nor do we characterize how many distinct
 * granules of size N are touched, where interesting values of
 * N would relate to various caching mechanisms such as
 *   - data cache line: 64-bytes or (occasionally) 128-bytes
 *   - TLB entry for 4K page
 *   - TLB entry for huge (512K) page
 * Nor do we characterize the "page walk working set" or the
 * amount of space that would be taken up by caching one or more
 * levels of page table.
 *
 * Other things being equal, for a dense working set we'd expect
 *   - number of 4K pages to be size / 4K
 *   - one TLB entry per page assuming no compression
 * So for an 8M working set with no huge pages we'd have
 *   - 2048 pages
 *   - 2048 last-level page table entries
 *   - 16K of last-level page tables

/* 
Construct a data working set, given some characteristics. The output is a contiguous
area of memory consisting of a granules (generally of cache line size) with a pointer
at the start of each granule. The pointers form a linked chain of pointers, which when
followed, will exhibit the desired working set characteristics.

Return NULL if we fail to allocate the data working set.

The input characteristics are as follows:

  - the total working set span (c->data_working_set)

  - TBD: add working set density e.g. number of cache lines touched

The first word of this working set should be the first link in a circular chain of data.

Layout is randomized in order to avoid hardware prefetching.

When the workload is run, it starts at the first link in the chain, and progressively
steps through the chain.  To fully utilize the working set, we need to process the
whole chain - so the workload must do at least that number of loads before being
reset to the beginning of the chain.  If the workload is a relatively small number of 
instructions it must either be wrapped by a loop or must remember its state from
one run to the next.
