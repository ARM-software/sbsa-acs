The code for reading events is complicated.
We have to cope with several cases:

  - reading an event using a read() system call on an event descriptor
  - reading a sample out of an mmap() buffer
  - reading an event using userspace-readable hardware counters
  - reading a group of events in a single action
  - returning the difference between the current event values
    and values taken at the last reset (see comment at event_reset)

From the user point of view, the interface is as follows:

 - Event::read() creates and returns a Reading or GroupReading object,
   depending on whether the event was opened with PERF_FORMAT_GROUP

 - Record::reading() creates and returns a Reading or GroupReading object
   from a sample embedded in a Record of type PERF_RECORD_SAMPLE.

Internally:

 - event_read(e)
   - take_reading(e,NULL)
     - allocate reading object r (Reading or GroupReading)
     - perf_read_count(r)
       - perf_read_count_userspace if possible
         - read metadata from mmap page and use rdpmc/mrs
       - perf_read_count_using_read otherwise
         - read(e->fd) to call the kernel
           - for a group, this gets all the readings
       - postprocess_reading


 - data for a single event (a single counter, possibly with
   time_enabled/time_running) is captured in event_sample_t
