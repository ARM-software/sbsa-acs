## Introduction to PCIe Exerciser Endpoint Device

PCIe Exerciser is a client device wrapped up by PCIe Endpoint. This device was created to meet SBSA (Server Based System Architecture) requirements for various PCIe
capability validation tests. Exerciser's BAR0 space contains following control and support registers to support various PCIe capabilities in exerciser:

```
 Register Name                   Description                                       Address offset
 -------------                   -----------                                       --------------

 MSI Control Register            Configure and trigger MSIs.                             0x0

 Legacy Interrupt Control        Configure and trigger legacy interrupts.                0x4
 Register

 DMA Control Register            Configure and trigger DMA transactions(DMA_CTL_REG)     0x8

 DMA Offset Register             Configure DMA transaction access offset (in bytes)      0xc
                                 from base of exerciser memory.

 Bus Address Register            Configure bus address that is destination/source        0x10
                                 for DMA or untranslated input address for ATSRequest.

 DMA Length Register             Configure DMA transaction length.                       0x18

 DMA Status Register             Status of last DMA transaction.                         0x1c

 PASID Value Register            Store the pasid value passed for initiating DMA/ATS     0x20
                                 transaction.

 ATS Control Register            Configure and trigger ATS transaction(ATS_CTL_REG)      0x24

 ATS Reply Translated Address    Hold the translated address returned from an            0x28
 Register                        ATSRequest.

 ATS Translated Range Size       Size of the ATS translated address region in bytes.     0x30
 Register

 ATS Reply Permission            Permissions returned for translated memory address      0x38
 Register                        region as a result of ATSRequest.

 Illegal Requestor ID            This register is DANGEROUS, as it will cause illegal    0x3c
 Control Register                transactions to be generated by exerciser.
                                 Use case is when SW wants exerciser to issue a
                                 transaction with custom/illegal requestor id,
                                 rather than the one determined through PCI enumeration.

 Transaction Trace Database      Holds information about the config and memory           0x40
 Register                        transactions. Each read will return one 32 bit entry
                                 previously recorded.

 Transaction Trace Control       Control bit to start/stop transaction monitoring.       0x44
 Register

```

 **HOW TO USE DMA**

  * Before triggering DMA all the required DMA attribute fields like DMA bus address,
    dmatxnsnoop etc., fields should be correctly set in the following registers:
     * DMA Control Register
     * Bus Address Register
     * DMA Length Register
     * DMA Requestor ID Register
     * DMA Transaction Offset Register
     * PASID Value Register

  * If user wants to do a Pure Translated transaction for a virtual address which is in ATC's input
    address range then dmaUseATCforTranslation bit must be set to true, so that input virtual address
    will be mapped to translated address as per ATC fields and translated address will go on the bus for DMA.

  * User can set custom requestor ID for an DMA transaction by using Illegal Requestor ID Control Register.
    Note: This is illegal as per PCIe specification as requestor ID should be assigned during PCIe enumeration.

  * If passed address for DMA transaction is already translated one, then dmaAddressType must be set to translated.
    Note: This bypasses the ATC and so is also illegal as per PCIe specification as only a transaction translated
    by the ATC is allowed to go out on the bus as a Translated Transaction. Also, if dmaAddressType is set to translated
    and dmaUseATCforTranslation bit is set, then exerciser will fault by logging an error message while initiating DMA,
    as translation mapping of an already translated address might go wrong.

  * DMAPasidEn bit must be set to 1 when a valid PASID is passed for DMA transaction. If dmaIsPrivileged
    or dmaIsInstruction is 1, then DMAPasidEn bit must be set to 1 for correct DMA response.

  * Status of the last DMA request can be known from DMA Status Register.

**MSI Generation and Service**

```
 MSI Control Register   Bit           Description                       r/w      Value at reset
 --------------------   ---           -----------                       ---      --------------

 MSICTLID               10:0          Index of MSI to be triggered       RW         0h
                                      (0 to 2047)

 MSICTLRES              30:11         Reserved                           RO         0h

 MSICTLTRG              31            Set to 1 to trigger MSI.           RW         0b
                                      This bit is reset after MSI
                                      is sent.
```

 **HOW TO TRIGGER MSI:**

  * Poll until (MSI Control Register).MSICTLTRG == 0.
  * Write MSI Control Register with MSICTLTRG == 1 and MSICTLID == desired MSI Index to initiate
    MSI from exerciser device.

**Legacy Interrupt Generation and Service**

```
 Legacy Interrupt Control Register  Bit      Description                    r/w    Value at reset
 ---------------------------------  ----     -----------                    ---    --------------

 intxctltrg                         0        Trigger legacy interrupt       RW      0b
                                             Set to 1 to trigger
                                             interrupt Reset this bit
                                             to clear interrupt

 intxctlres                        31:1      Reserved                       RO      0h

```

 **HOW TO TRIGGER LEGACY/PIN INTERRUPT:**

  * Write 1 into intxctltrg to trigger legacy pin interrupt from exerciser device.

 **HOW TO USE ATS:**

  * Before starting an ATS request, untranslated input address for ATSRequest must be written onto
    Bus Address Register, with all related bit (is_read, etc.) set in ATS_CTL_REG.
    SW should enable ATS and PASID capability for exerciser (which will set exerciser_ats_enabled and
    exerciser_ats_pasid_enabled, where exerciser_ats_enabled will enable client side ATS Transaction
    capability for exerciser and exerciser_ats_pasid_enabled will enable PASID based ATSRequest for exerciser).
    Then ATS request can be triggered. Registers to be used for ATS:
     * ATS Control Register
     * PASID Value Register
     * ATS Reply Translated Address Register
     * ATS Reply Permission Register
     * ATS Translated Range Size Register

  * If there is any fault occurred during the translation, then error log will get reflected in
    command line as MSG_INFO and status of ATSRequest remains as 0 (failed - by default). User can
    detect whether error has occurred during the translation when following condition is true:

    * ATSRequest is not in flight (ATS_CTL_REG[6] == 0) and ATS transaction status bit (ATS_CTL_REG[7]) is 0.

  * If ATSRequest response result is cacheable (RW!= 2'b00 : Read/Write permission returned as ATSRequest result),
    then ATS response cacheable bit (ATS_CTL_REG[8]) is set to true.

  * If a matching ATC invalidation comes while ATS request is in flight, translation will be retried, discarding
    the current translation result.

  * If there is no error and translation response is cacheable, then translation result will be stored in ATC
    along with permissions returned.

  * Translation result will also get reflected in ATS Reply Translated Address Register,
    ATS Reply Permission Register, ATS Translated Range Size Register

  * DMA transaction's range must be fully covered by the ATC entry or it will fail.

  * Whenever any DMA transaction want to use ATC based translated address, it must set
    dmaUseATCforTranslation flag (DMA_CTL_REG[11]) to true, so that translated address will go into the bus
    after being remapped to translated output address if it has all the necessary read/write permissions.

  * Currently exerciser can store maximum 1 ATS request result, mappings are stored in ATC till invalidated by SMMU or
    user writes 1 to clear ATC bit (ATS_CTL_REG[5]) which will clear/invalidate all ATC mappings and fields.

  * ATC invalidation happens in following ways when an ATCInvalidate Request received by the exerciser:

    * If ATC is empty, then there is nothing to be invalidated, ATC invalidation call gets returned immediately.

    * Some form of invalidation will be done when invalidation range contains ATC's untranslated input address
      and either of the following is true:
        * Invalidation range contains address for which any ongoing ATSRequest is in progress.
        * SubstreamID is valid for both atc_invalidate request and atc_entry and
          either ATC invalidate's substreamID matches with atc_entry's substreamID
          or G-Global PASID bit is set.

    * If there is any ongoing ATS translation request with the address that is in atc_invalidation_address_range,
      then current translation result will be discarded, ATC will be invalidated and then current ATS translation request
      will be retried again.

    * If any DMA PCIe Translated transaction is using any address which is in atc_invalidation_address_range,
      then we wait for the DMA transaction to complete and then ATC invalidation is done.

    * If no PCIe Translated transaction is using any address which is in atc_invalidation_address_range,
      then we invalidate the ATC immediately if invalidation_range intersects/matches with atc_entry's untranslated
      address.

  * ATC can be invalidated by writing 1 to clear ATC bit (ATS_CTL_REG[5]), which will eventually invalidate ATC and discard
    all the mappings for last ATSRequest.

  * Note: the following ATS behaviours are illegal under the PCIe specification, but implemented in the model for validation purposes only:
    * reading the ATC entry
    * issuing a translated transaction without using the ATC

**Transaction Monitoring**

Transaction monitoring capabilities in the exerciser provides the ability to record the incoming transactions, for both config
and memory transactions. This includes,

* config read and write transactions serviced in PCIe endpoints.

* memory transactions serviced in PCIe endpoint BARs.

* memory transactions which are forwarded from PCIe endpoint to device(like exerciser).


Each recorded transaction has the following information:

  * a 32 bit entry indicating transaction attributes. It has bitfields for request
    type, R/W transaction, cfg/mem transaction and transaction byte size(bitfields given below)

  * a 32 bit entry indicating lower 32 bits of config or memory address

  * a 32 bit entry indicating upper 32 bits of config or memory address

  * a 32 bit entry indicating lower 32 bits of transaction data read or written to

  * a 32 bit entry indicating upper 32 bits of transaction data read or written to

Note: Each beat in a burst transaction is recorded as a single separate transaction.

 TransactionTraceReg         Bit          Description                      R/W    Value at reset
 -------------------         ---          -----------                      ---    --------------
  Transaction Info.          31:0         Returns one 32 bit entry
                                          mentioned above on each          RO      0xFFFFffff
                                          read.

  For transaction attributes (TX_ATTRIBUTES), lower 16 bits indicates the type, R/W and cfg/mem information.
  Upper 16 bits of transaction attributes indicates transaction byte size. The bit indicating the
  transaction byte size is calculated as log2(bytes). For example, if size is 8, bit3 of the upper 16 bits
  will be set.

```


 **HOW TO USE TRANSACTION MONITORING:**
  * Number of transactions recorded depends on the exerciser parameter 'max_transaction_trace_entries'. The maximum
    entries supported is 32, defaults to 16, minimum 1.
  * To start transaction monitoring, write 0x1 to transaction trace control register(offset 0x44).
  * To stop transaction monitoring, write 0x0 to transaction trace control register(offset 0x44).
  * Read the transaction trace database register(offset 0x40). Each read returns one 32 bit entry mentioned above, starting
    from first transaction. A value of 0xFFFFffff indicates invalid entry.
